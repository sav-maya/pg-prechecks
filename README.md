NAME
    pg-prechecks - Summarizes information about your PostgreSQL instance to help
    prepare migration into Neon

SYNOPSIS
  Usage: pg-prechecks [OPTIONS]

  pg-prechecks summarizes the status and configuration of a PostgreSQL database
    server so that you can learn about it at a glance, and it allows
    you to share the relevant information with Neon. It is not a
    tuning tool or diagnosis tool. It produces a report that is easy to diff
    and can be pasted into emails without losing the formatting. It should
    work well on any modern UNIX systems.

  pg-prechecks is a heavily modified version of pt-pg-summary, which is
    part of the Percona Toolkit.

RISKS 
    pg-prechecks is designed to connect to your live database environment,
    execute queries to collect the relevant information, and
    process/summarize the data without further impacting your database
    environment. While this script is well-tested, any database tool can pose
    a risk to your database environment.

  Before using this tool, please:
    - Read the tool's documentation
    - Test the tool on a non-production server first
    - Backup your production server and verify the backups

## Security Note

This script requires database credentials. Ensure you're using it in a secure environment and avoid exposing passwords in command-line arguments on shared systems.

```

## Features

- Collects version information
- Lists databases and their sizes
- Reports top 20 table and index sizes
- Retrieves important configuration settings
- Lists installed extensions
- Provides a summary of current database activity
- Counts total indexes
- Lists user roles
- Checks for logical replication support
- Reports the number of active replicas
- Identifies long-running queries
- Reports on locks information
- Optionally performs a version-agnostic database dump

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL client (`psql`) installed and accessible from the command line
- Network access to the target PostgreSQL instance (RDS)

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x pg-prechecks.sh
   ```

2. Run the script with the required parameters:
   ```
   ./pg-prechecks --host=your-db-host --user=your-username --password=your-password [options]
   ```

   Required parameters:
   - `--host`: The hostname or IP address of your PostgreSQL instance
   - `--user`: The username to connect to the database
   - `--password`: The password for the specified user

   Optional parameters:
   - `--port`: The port number (default is 5432)
   - `--dbname`: The name of the database to connect to (default is "postgres")
   - `--dump`: Include this flag to perform a version-agnostic database dump

## Output

The script creates a directory named `pg_precheck_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` containing:

- Individual text files with detailed information for each checked aspect
- A summary report file `summary_report.md` in Markdown format
- If the `--dump` option is used, a `database_dump.sql` file containing a version-agnostic dump of the database


## Example Output

After running the script, you'll get a summary report in Markdown format. Here's a sample of what it might look like:

This summary provides a quick overview of your PostgreSQL instance's state, including version, database sizes, table sizes, settings, activity, and potential issues like long-running queries or locks.

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Ensure you have the correct permissions to access the database.
2. Check that the PostgreSQL client tools are correctly installed and configured.
3. Verify that you can connect to the database manually using the same credentials.
